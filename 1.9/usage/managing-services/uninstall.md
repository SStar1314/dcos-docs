## About uninstalling services

Services can be uninstalled from either the web interface or the CLI. If the service has any reserved resources, you also need to run the framework cleaner script. The framework cleaner script removes the service instance from ZooKeeper, along with any data associated with it.  

## Uninstalling a service

### Uninstalling a service using the CLI

1.  Uninstall a datacenter service with this command:

    ```bash
    $ dcos package uninstall <servicename>
    ```

    For example, to uninstall Chronos:

    ```bash
    $ dcos package uninstall chronos
    ```

### Uninstalling a service using the UI

From the DC/OS UI you can uninstall services from the **Services** or **Universe** tab. The Universe tab shows all of the available DC/OS services from package [repositories](/docs/1.9/usage/repo/). The Services tab provides a full featured interface to the native DC/OS Marathon instance.

### Universe tab

1.  Navigate to the **Universe** page in the DC/OS [UI](/docs/1.9/usage/webinterface/#universe).

2.  Click on the **Installed** tab to see your installed services.

3.  Hover your cursor over the name of the package you wish to uninstall and you will see a red "Uninstall" link to the right. Click this link to uninstall the package.

### Services tab

1.  Navigate to the [**Services**](/docs/1.9/usage/webinterface/#services) tab in the DC/OS UI.
1.  Select your application and click **Edit**, then select the **More -> Destroy**.

## <a name="framework-cleaner"></a>Cleaning up ZooKeeper

### About Cleaning up ZooKeeper

If your service has reserved resources, you can use the framework cleaner docker image, `mesosphere/janitor`, to simplify the process of removing your service instance from ZooKeeper and destroying all the data associated with it.

There are two ways to run the framework cleaner script. The preferred method is via the DC/OS CLI. If the CLI is unavailable, you can also run the image as a self-deleting Marathon task.

### Configuring the cleanup

The script takes the following flags:

* `-r`: The role of the resources to be deleted
* `-p`: The principal of the resources to be deleted
* `-z`: The configuration zookeeper node to be deleted

These are some examples of default configurations (these will vary depending on selected task name, etc):

* Cassandra default: docker run mesosphere/janitor /janitor.py -r cassandra-role -p cassandra-principal -z dcos-service-cassandra
* HDFS default: docker run mesosphere/janitor /janitor.py -r hdfs-role -p hdfs-principal -z dcos-service-hdfs
* Kafka default: docker run mesosphere/janitor /janitor.py -r kafka-role -p kafka-principal -z dcos-service-kafka
* Custom values: docker run mesosphere/janitor /janitor.py -r <custom_role> -p <custom_principal> -z dcos-service-<custom_service_name>

### Running from the DC/OS CLI

Connect to the leader and start the script:

1. Open an SSH session to the cluster leader.

        your-machine$ dcos node ssh --master-proxy --leader

1. Run the `mesosphere/janitor` image with the role, principal, and zookeeper nodes that were configured for your service:

        leader$ docker run mesosphere/janitor /janitor.py -r sample-role -p sample-principal -z sample-zk

### Running from Marathon

From the DC/OS [**Services**](/docs/1.9/usage/webinterface) tab, use the JSON editor to add the following as a Marathon task. Replace the values passed to `-r`/`-p`/`-z` according to what needs to be cleaned up.

    {
      "id": "janitor",
      "cmd": "/janitor.py -r sample-role -p sample-principal -z sample",
      "cpus": 1,
      "mem": 128,
      "disk": 1,
      "instances": 1,
      "container": {
        "docker": {
          "image": "mesosphere/janitor:latest",
          "network": "HOST"
        },
        "type": "DOCKER"
      }
    }
    
When the framework cleaner has completed its work, it will automatically remove itself from Marathon to ensure that it's only run once. This removal will often result in a `TASK_KILLED` or even a `TASK_FAILED` outcome for the janitor task, even if it finished successfully. The janitor task will also quickly disappear from both the Services and Dashboard tab.

### Verifying the outcome

To view the script's outcome, go to Mesos (http://your-cluster.com/mesos) and look at the task's `stdout` content. If `stdout` lacks content, run the following command manually:

    # Determine id of agent which ran the Docker task. This is an example:
    
    your-machine$ dcos node ssh --master-proxy --mesos-id=c62affd0-ce56-413b-85e7-32e510a7e131-S3
    
    agent-node$ docker ps -a
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                       COMMAND             ...
    828ee17b5fd3        mesosphere/janitor:latest   /bin/sh -c /janito  ...
    
    agent-node$ docker logs 828ee17b5fd3
    
### Sample result

Here's an example of the output for a successful run for a Cassandra installation:

    your-machine$ dcos node ssh --master-proxy --leader

    leader-node$ docker run mesosphere/janitor /janitor.py -r cassandra_role -p cassandra_principal -z cassandra
    [... docker download ...]
    Master: http://leader.mesos:5050/master/ Exhibitor: http://leader.mesos:8181/ Role: cassandra_role Principal: cassandra_principal ZK Path: cassandra
